I made a fun little drumkit using one of the tutorials from https://javascript30.com. It was made in a day. I then took it a little further to learn a little more about how things function. I also wanted to add a little of my own flavor to it with some cool gradient colors and some custom sounds. I got inspired by Neil Hanson and Alhousseine Camara, so double shout out to them!
