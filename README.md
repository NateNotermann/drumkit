# drumkit
I made a fun little drumkit using one of the tutorials from Javascript30. I thought I would take it a little further by adding some cool gradient colors and some custom sounds. I got inspired by Neil Hanson and Alhousseine Camara, so double shout out to them!

Thereâ€™s a special message that plays if you tap the top row of keys in order from left to right.
